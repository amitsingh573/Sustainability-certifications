Starting coding as a complete beginner involves picking a simple language, setting up basics, and practicing daily through small projects.​

Choose a Language

Python is ideal for newcomers due to its readable syntax and versatility in web, data, and automation tasks. JavaScript suits web development for interactive sites.​

Setup Essentials

Download Python from python.org and use a free editor like Visual Studio Code. Test with a "Hello, World!" script: print("Hello, World!").​

Learning Path

Follow free platforms: freeCodeCamp for interactive lessons, Codecademy for basics, or GeeksforGeeks for exercises. Build projects like a calculator or to-do list, join Reddit's r/learnprogramming for help. Practice 30 minutes daily, focusing on variables, loops, and functions before advancing.​
